 - **hmd**: No changes made from original
 - **HOD_emulation_LCDM**: Used to construct an HOD emulator for LCDM cosmology only. Only used as an exercise before emulating cosmology as well.
 - **individual_HOD_parameter_variation**: Previously used to study the effect each individual HOD parameter has on the HODs and the TPCF, using LCDM cosmology. Only meant for learning purposes.
 - **HOD_and_cosmo_emulation**: Contains the scripts for generating HOD catalogues, computing correlation functions, preparing the emulation data and estimating the covariance matrix needed for parameter inference. Covers a wide range of HOD parameters for every Abacus cosmology.
     - See separate Readme in this subdirectory for detailed explanations.
