# HOD
Generate mock galaxy catalogues from dark matter (DM) halo data for a given Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) parameterization. 
Constructs a large number of catalogues from each DM simulation, and compute the Two-point correlation function (TPCF) of galaxies. 
The resulting data is used to construct a neural network emulator to predict the TPCF given a set of input cosmological parameters.
